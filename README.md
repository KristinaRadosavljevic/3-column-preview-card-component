## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/Sass
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was another very simple challenge which only gave me some further opportunity to practice what I already know.

One thing I did learn was how to override the `justify-content` property on one of the flex items - [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23621650/how-to-justify-a-single-flexbox-item-override-justify-content) gave me the idea to use `margin-top: auto;` on the buttons to keep them in line when the paragraphs above them are not all the same height.

### Continued development

In the future projects, I would like to focus a bit more on practicing CSS grid and not just flexbox.
